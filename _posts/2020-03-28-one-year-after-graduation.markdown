# Life Update

I've officially hit the one-year mark for working full-time at Facebook in Menlo Park â€” it's been a long year to say the least. I've enjoyed not having to pack up my bags every four months to move for an internship or school term. But I do miss the spontaneity of that lifestyle and getting excited about what could be up next in the short term. 

Right after hitting a year, the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. It made me stop and think about what happened in the past year.

# What Has Really Changed?

# What's Life Like?

Making closes friends become more difficult.

# What's Next?

During this outbreak, I've had more time to contemplate life. I wouldn't say I know what's next.
