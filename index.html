    I'm a software engineer based in the Bay Area

  <p class="intro-blurb">
    I have 4+ years of experience in the industry: I previously worked at

    I'm a generalist that enjoys full-stack web development and occasionally mobile development.

  <h2 class="page-heading">Besides engineering</h2>
  <p class="intro-blurb">
    For the past six months, I took a sabbatical to travel and spend time with friends and family.
    During this time, I developed an interest in creating content on 
    <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.youtube }}/">
      YouTube
    </a>
    for fun to share weekly vlogs with friends.
