I"Æ<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My nameâ€™s Cora (yep, just like the Canadian breakfast restaurant and not The Legend of Korra). After studying Software Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Waterloo, I moved to the Bay Area to work full-time.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve got any questions / ideas / thoughts / just want to chat, Iâ€™d love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:coralam17@gmail.com">coralam17@gmail.com</a>.</p>
