Welcome! My name's Cora (yep, just like the Canadian breakfast restaurant and not The Legend of Korra). After studying Computer Science at The University of Waterloo, I moved to the Bay Area to work full-time.

If you've got any questions / ideas / thoughts / just want to chat, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me at [coralam17@gmail.com](mailto:coralam17@gmail.com).
