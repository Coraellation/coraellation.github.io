Hi there!

My name's Cora (yep, just like the breakfast restaurant and not The Legend of Korra) and I'm studying Software Engineering at The University of Waterloo. Iâ€™ll be periodically posting about student and co-op life here. 

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me at [coralam17@gmail.com](mailto:coralam17@gmail.com) or [cora.lam@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:cora.lam@uwaterloo.ca).
